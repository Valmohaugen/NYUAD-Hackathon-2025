# üß† NeurotiQ ‚Äî Quantum Machine Learning for EEG Signal Analysis  
**NYUAD Social Impact Hackathon 2025**  

---

## Overview  
NeurotiQ leverages **Quantum Machine Learning (QML)** algorithms to enhance EEG signal analysis, revolutionizing mental health diagnosis for conditions such as depression, ADHD, and anxiety.  

Our focus is on demonstrating how quantum-enhanced models can uncover intricate EEG patterns that classical machine learning models struggle to identify.  

**Core technologies:**  
- **Quantum Libraries:** `Qiskit`, `PennyLane`  
- **Classical Libraries:** `Scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, etc.

## Models  
We have developed and rigorously tested **four models** to date:  
- **2 Classical models** (baseline for comparison)  
- **2 Quantum-enhanced models** (our innovative approach)  

### Classical Models  
1. **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** A traditional method for classification tasks.  
2. **Regression models:** A logistic regression approach trained on EEG features.  

### Quantum Models  
1. **Quantum Neural Network (QNN):**  
   - EEG data is transformed into quantum states using **amplitude encoding**.  
   - **Strongly entangling layers** are applied to exploit quantum correlations.  
   - Combines **quantum feature extraction** with classical classification layers for a hybrid approach.  

2. **Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM):**  
   - EEG features are embedded into quantum states using **amplitude encoding**.  
   - A **quantum kernel** is calculated by analyzing quantum state overlaps.  
   - Enhanced separability is achieved by training a SVC with the quantum kernel.

## Results  
| **Model**           | **Anxiety AUC** | **Depression AUC** |  **Anxiety Accuracy**  | **Depression Accuracy**|  
|----------------------|-----------------|--------------------|------------------------|------------------------|  
| **Classical Models** |  68%            |  68%               |  38%                   |  69%                   |  
| **QSVM**             | **79%**         | **73%**            | **81%**                | **70%**                |  

‚úÖ Our performance findings demonstrate the **superiority of quantum-enhanced models**, underlining their potential for impactful applications in mental health diagnostics.
